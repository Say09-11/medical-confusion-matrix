    "",
    "1. Extract Text:",
    "   - Read the provided “Findings (original radiologist report)” and “Findings (AI report)”.",
    "   - Normalize text: lowercase, remove extra spaces, handle minor typos, and standardize common medical abbreviations (e.g., “CHF” → “cardiomegaly”, “ILD” → “interstitial lung disease”).",
    "",
    "2. Understand Context:",
    "   - Interpret the meaning — do not rely solely on word presence.",
    "   - Detect negations: “no evidence of pneumonia” means pneumonia = negative.",
    "   - Detect uncertainty: “mildly suggestive of” → treat as **positive but low confidence** (still count as positive).",
    "   - Distinguish anatomical mentions that imply the same finding (e.g., “perihilar opacity” → “perihilar_infiltrate”).",
    "",
    "3. Term Classification:",
    "   For each terminology, determine:",
    "   - AI_Positive → AI report suggests or confirms that finding.",
    "   - Rad_Positive → Radiologist report confirms that finding.",
    "   - If a finding is explicitly ruled out (“no signs of”, “absent”), mark as **Negative**.",
    "",
    "4. Generate Confusion Categories:",
    "   - True Positive (TP): AI and Radiologist both detect it.",
    "   - True Negative (TN): Neither detects it.",
    "   - False Positive (FP): AI detects but Radiologist does not.",
    "   - False Negative (FN): Radiologist detects but AI does not.",

This opacity reduces approximately 50% of the dorsoventral diameter of the trachea. The intrathoracic trachea is normal. Within the lung parenchyma there is a mixed bronchointerstitial opacification, predominantly caudal dorsally. The mainstem bronchi taper poorly. There is mild focal interstitial opacification in the left cranial lung lobe adjacent to the rib sections, however some obliquity is present. No associated osteolysis of the ribs is seen.",
